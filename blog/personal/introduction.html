        <p>Hi. My name is Jordan. I don't know how to start this thing, so I'll just introduce myself. Nice to meet you, whoever you may be. But this post is not for you. No, it's actually for me. I'll be using these posts to keep track of, verbalize, and hold myself accountable for my personal and professional development. One of the best ways to learn something is to explain and teach it. And by getting my thoughts out into the real world, I will be better able to sort them inside my own crazy brain.</p>
        <p>A little bit about me. I work remotely, I'm in marketing. Dental marketing to be exact (I know, it's very boring). I've worked remotely for 5 years now. I started working with my agency, <a href="https://www.roadsidedentalmarketing.com/" target="_blank">Roadside Dental Marketing</a>, straight out of high school. Taking advantage of working remotely, at 18 years old I got a backback ready, bought a one-way flight to Paris and didn't look back. Not for 9 months that is, which I discovered is the amount of time it takes me to start feeling homesick.</p>
        <p>I love traveling. It's a major part of who I am. But after too long it becomes quite apparent that I'm missing something more stable. Home. Living out of a backpack - a week here, a month there, Paris, Krakow, Bangkok, Tokyo ... something seems to be missing. Of course, once I return home, it only takes 3 months to get bored and want to leave again. It wasn't long before I bought another one-way ticket, to New Delhi this time. That's why I'm here.</p>
        <p>One of the big things I (used to) feel I missed out on is career growth and opportunities. I had an unbelievably lucky entry into remote work, and I never put down roots. I couldn't help but feel like I was wasting my potential. I still feel that way sometimes. That's why I'm writing this now, and hopefully for the days, weeks, and years to come. To keep learning, to hold myself accountable, and to keep track of just how far I've come along the way.</p>
        <p>My main goal is to develop into the best person I can be, to take the time to stop and enjoy the process, and sometimes to just look back on all I've accomplished. I don't always enjoy what I do, and it can be hard to push myself to do better, to push myself to learn something new, or work on that project I've been thinking of. I don't know if I'll start my own business, work my way into FAANG, or just keep tinkering on little projects here and there. What I do know, is that it takes hard work to look for and find the good in life, to be accomplished, to be successful - whatever your definition of success may be. This post is but the first of many. I hope someone somewhere enjoys reading them, even if it's only me.</p>
