    <!-- BLOG POST SECTION -->
     <section class="post container">
        <p>I want to take a break from computers today. I was writing this morning and I realized that computers are such a small part of who I am, in fact, I don’t even consider myself very good with them. Instead, I’d like to turn this blog into a place I can explore myself - I’d like to share my thoughts, opinions, musings, passions, what I’m reading, how I feel - I’d like to explore who I am. Who am I? I’m still figuring it out.</p>

            <p>It’s so funny how difficult it can be to put thoughts into words. To structure our internal expressions and reveal them, if only to ourselves. I had all these thoughts I wanted to put down, sentences I wanted to write - what I wanted to say, how I wanted to say it… but when it came time to write, it felt like a candle going out. There are some vestiges left, words or feelings - impressions - on the tip of my tongue, as if I recall the place they used to be, but cannot recall exactly what they were - or are. So I’ll try my best.</p>
        
            <p>Everything I do is to connect to other people. As far as I recall, it seems to me that I’ve always done things because I believe it to be expected of me. I crave connection, I crave approval, and if I can only do what you are doing, reflect your words or your actions, maybe, probably, you’ll like me - I’ll be approved of. I don’t know if I’ve ever felt other or apart from people in the past, but I feel it now, and I’m asking myself why.</p>
        
            <p>My personality is to question everything. To inquire and to be sceptical. I consider it a blessing and a curse. It’s not easy, nor is it calming. I think that’s why I’m writing now. A quote that has stuck with me since I’ve heard it, a Sutra of Patanjali: <em>“Yogas citta vritti nirodhah”</em>. When translated it means <em>“Yoga is the cessation of the fluctuations of the mind.”</em> Yoga itself means union, unity; in this instance, I would translate it to peace. Indeed, peace comes from the completion of thoughts, ideas, and expressions. Likewise, the bible says <em>“The lamp of the body is the eye. If, then, your eye is focused, your whole body will be bright.”</em> (Matthew 6:22). I think of an object or person trying to move in multiple directions at once. To do so it would need to literally tear itself apart, I would need to tear myself apart. We can only move in one direction at a time, yet our minds process and record everything at once. I’ve concluded that only by manifesting my thoughts into physical words, can I truly (and competently) examine, then refine them. In so doing, create unity, peace for myself.</p>
        
            <p>This isn’t exactly a spur of the moment thing, but a culmination of years of internal struggle, months of reflective journaling, and a desire to be the change I wish to see in myself. I’m in Paris at the moment. I love it here, I felt a connection to French and the French from the very moment I set foot in the country for the first time almost 5 years ago. I was reminded of that connection, and the desire to move here came so much more strongly now than it did then. A good friend counseled me against brash decisions and judgements (which I so dearly need), he said:</p>

        <blockquote><em>“We create the meaning of a place through our routines, activities, and the community we build, not because a particular place calls out to us… Right now, I feel it’s more important to focus on stability rather than the hassle of adapting to a new country and language in the global economic decline and constant rise in inflation. I think staying grounded and building on what we already have will give us a stronger foundation for the future.”</em></blockquote>

            <p>At first, I didn’t like this counsel. While I immediately agreed with all the points on a surface level, I felt a disconnect between myself and the meaning of the words. It had to do with life stage and maturity. I felt that as a 23 year old, finding my place in the world required or deserved some risk. As “free” as I may seem, I am quite risk-averse. I like to think and plan, and only act when I’m 100% sure of the outcome. I felt this risk was worth the reward and any potential pitfalls can be dealt with. Mostly, I didn’t want to hear counsel against how I felt. But I thought about it, and the longer I thought about it, the more wise the words became. I questioned myself, as I so often do these days, asking <em>“what is it that <b>I</b> want?”</em></p>
            <p>I want to feel like I belong. I realize that I also want to become someone else. I want to be someone more charismatic, more attractive and more charming. Someone quicker, smarter, and wittier. Someone more bold, more successful, more outgoing. Someone anyone would want to be around. I feel as if I may be blind to the fact that I am, at least in part, already all of these things. But usually I don’t feel like any of them, I don’t feel that I am enough. Of course, my friend is correct. Changing your surroundings accomplishes none of these things. It cannot change me into a different person. Who I am and how I feel will stay the same regardless of the place that I am in. True peace and unity - real change within myself - depends not on a time or place, but in the pattern that I create within my life. It belongs to the little details, the thoughts I choose to focus on, the words I choose to share, the actions that reveal who I am. Change belongs to the small hours of the morning, and the long hours of the night, day-in and day-out.</p>
            <p>One of the first steps I want to take is to eliminate self-consciousness. And so I circle back to the reason why I’m writing this now, and will proceed to publish it for others to read - I don’t want to allow myself to be too nervous or too self-conscious to share my thoughts and opinions, to be myself - and so I won’t be those things. I choose not to be those things. I need these reminders to be myself, be genuine, and don’t worry what others may or may not think. And, to always remember - I am enough.</p>
            <p>I may still move to Paris. I do so love it here. But I will do so knowing that who I am and who I wish to be isn’t dictated by my environment but by the actions I choose to take.</p>
